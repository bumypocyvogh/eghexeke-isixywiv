Overview
If you are like most people, you eat a lot of chicken. But chances are you havenâ€™t had chicken like Matt Hornâ€™s chicken. Now you can! Learn how to make the best chicken on the planet, from a true master of the art, in this fun and inspiring book.
 
 Celebrated chef Matt Horn spent years perfecting his chicken recipes before he opened his widely acclaimed mecca for chicken cookery, Kowbird, in Oakland, California.Â Even to this day, he continues to experiment with different cuts of chicken, with a host of sauces and spice mixtures that bring out the best flavors in chicken, and with all sorts of cooking techniques that make this popular food explode with flavor on the palate. In the richly photographed pages of Kowbird, he shares his hard-won wisdom and his brilliantly creative culinary wizardry, elevating the humble bird to its rightful place at the center of the plateâ€”and as the star of the meal.
 
 Matt gives you 65 recipes packed with flavor and creativity for everything from comforting weekday dinners to spectacular weekend feasts. Itâ€™s time to set aside the tired old chicken spaghetti, chicken parmesan, and unadorned chicken cutlets and dig into:
 Â  Zingy Chile-Crisp-Rubbed Grilled Chicken Breasts Chicken-Fried Chicken, Mattâ€™s signature Southern-inflected riff on chicken-fried steak California Wings, which you dip in a zesty mash of garlic, avocado, onion, and lemon Mattâ€™s best-in-class version of Nashville Hot Chicken And much more deliciousness 
 With recipes for barbecuing, grilling, smoking, sautÃ©ing, brazing, baking, broiling, pan-frying, deep-frying,Â and more, this is a book thatÂ takes chicken to delectable places youâ€™ve never dreamed of before.
