In the sweet and charming follow-up to the beloved picture book Harold Loves His Woolly Hat, little bear Harold is NOT ready to to go to sleep--and, just like kids everywhere, he makes every attempt to stay awake. Harold loves the springtime flowers. And spending time with friends on summer days. In the fall, he loves the bright, bold colors. But now winter is coming, and Harold will have to go to sleep...only he really doesn&amp;#039;t want to. Harold is determined to stay awake. So, with help from his friends the crows, he tries everything--from filling his belly with delicious berries to wearing cozy pajamas to keep him warm. Finally, snow starts to fall, and Harold finds he needs to rest his eyes, just for a minute. When he finally dozes off, the crows return--with his woolly hat--to snuggle up for some winter rest. All kids will see themselves reflected in this sweet, cozy read aloud about bears (ahem, kids) who are NOT ready to go to sleep.
