&amp;#039;A wonderful tale of love, loss and community with folklore and magic. I adored it!&amp;#039; LIZ FENWICK
 
 A town in need.
 An extraordinary cat.
 A season for miracles...
 
 It&amp;#039;s nearly Christmas and committed Londoner, Mina Kestle, is close to signing a deal that will make her career and give her everything she&amp;#039;s ever wanted. And then she receives a mysterious letter in the post along with an ancient key, sent by her long-estranged godfather . . .
 
 Davy Penhallow is an artist who lives on the tiny Cornish island of Morgelyn with only his pet cat, Murr, for company. Mina hasn&amp;#039;t seen or heard from him in decades, but now it seems he wants her to look after his cottage - and his cat - while he recovers from a stroke in hospital. Mina doesn&amp;#039;t know why Davy has written after all these years, but she intends to do what&amp;#039;s right: sort out the cottage and the cat and then get back to London in time for her career-saving meeting, before everything she&amp;#039;s built comes crashing down around her.
 
 But the more time Mina spends in the cottage, looking after Murr and remembering the magic of Cornish folklore, the harder it becomes for her to tear herself away. And when she discovers that a set of ruthless property developers are coming for Morgelyn, she realises she might be the only one who can stand in their way to save the island, Davy&amp;#039;s cottage and Murr&amp;#039;s home.
 
 As Christmas draws ever closer and echoes of the past - her own and the island&amp;#039;s - wash up in her memory, Mina begins to unravel a generation of secrets... and discover what it is she has truly always wanted . . .
 
 The perfect magical read to cosy up with on chilly winter nights...
