Overview
Let the darkness riseâ€¦in the breathtaking conclusion to award-winning author Abigail Owenâ€™s Dominions series.
 
 King Eidolon has taken everything.
 
 My throne, my Shadowraith, and even my kingdom. I am a queen with no one to rule, and a tattered army that&#039;s not even mine. And hope is fading fast.
 
 Now the shadows who once tormented Reven live within me, hissing and wheedlingâ€”and enticing me to betray my friends. Which could be deadly for us all. Because without the guy I fell for, without Reven, I am all shadowsâ€¦and no light.
 
 And the Alignment is almost upon usâ€”the culmination of centuries that have fueled a vengeful kingâ€™s festering rage.
 
 Weâ€™re outnumbered. Weâ€™re underpowered. And even if we could unleash the trapped goddesses, they would destroy the kingdom and everything in it.
 
 The Dominions series is best enjoyed in order.
